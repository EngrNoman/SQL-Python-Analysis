# SQL-Python-Analysis

This repository showcases **data analysis projects** that combine the power of **SQL and Python** to extract insights from structured datasets. It includes real-world use cases demonstrating how SQL is used for **data extraction, transformation, and preprocessing**, while Python is leveraged for **statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning**.  

## ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Inside?  
- **SQL Queries** for filtering, aggregating, and transforming data.  
- **Python Notebooks** for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and modeling.  
- **Case Studies** applying SQL + Python to real-world datasets.  
- **Best Practices** for integrating SQL with Python using Pandas, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and other tools.  

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack  
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)  
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis  

## ðŸ”¹ Use Cases Covered  
âœ” Data Cleaning & Transformation  
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
âœ” Business Intelligence & Reporting  
âœ” Machine Learning on SQL-based Data
